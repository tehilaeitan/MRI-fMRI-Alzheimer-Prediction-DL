# MRI-fMRI-Alzheimer-Prediction-DL

This project is focused on developing advanced neural network architectures for early and efficient prediction of Alzheimerâ€™s Disease (AD), Mild Cognitive Impairments (MCI) and Cognitive Normal (CN). By integrating functional connectivity analysis in fMRI data through specific Regions of Interest (ROIs), this approach provides a robust framework for understanding brain function, which enhances the diagnosis and treatment of neurological and psychiatric disorders.

The model is designed to work with both 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers. 3D CNNs are powerful for analyzing volumetric data, capturing local spatial features, and providing a comprehensive view of the brain by learning spatial hierarchies in three dimensions. Vision Transformers, on the other hand, utilize self-attention mechanisms to capture global dependencies in the data. When combined with convolutional layers, they can effectively analyze complex spatiotemporal patterns in fMRI data.

The project includes the development and application of these neural network models to achieve comprehensive analysis of brain activity and connectivity. By leveraging the strengths of both 3D CNNs and Vision Transformers, the project aims to provide very accurate classifications of AD and MCI cases. This sets the stage for future research, where further improvements in model architectures and data processing techniques can lead to even more accurate and insightful findings in neuroimaging and brain research.
